Merge duplicated tags and categories to better organize the content of your site

== Description ==

Once a site starts growing, it always ends up with repeated tags and categories. Sometimes, you create a new category when you were before using a tag. Or you just forget about old tags and en up writing new ones with a very similar name.

This damages the organization your content and the quality of the user navigation on your site. 

This plugin helps you to quickly identify (too) similar tags and categories and gives you the option to merge them to simplify your site taxonomies. 

In the *Configuration* page you can define how close term names should be to be considered duplicates. 

In the *Analysis* page you can review the duplications and decide which ones to merge. 


== Installation ==

Install and Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I create a backup of my site before using the plugin? =

= Does the plugin work with custom taxonomies? =
