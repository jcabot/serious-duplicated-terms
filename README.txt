Develop a writing habit by setting and tracking a daily writing goal.

== Description ==

Good writing requires practice. This plugin helps you to form a daily writing habit by setting a daily writing goal and checking your progress against that goal.

In the *Writing goals* page you can define your desired writing target and the number of days to track. This second parameter is used when visualizing the report.

A widget in the *dashboard* will immediately remind you the writing goal and give feedback on how far you are today from the goal.

In the *Report* page you'll see a bar chart displaying the word counts from the last days plus two horizontal lines:

1. The target goal
2. Your writing average in the last days

This will help you to quickly see your progress (and hopefully, encourage you to write more!).


== Installation ==

Install and Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does removing text hampers achieving my writing goal? =

No. Removing text from old posts does not damages your word counting

= Are HTML characters or shortcodes counted as words? =

No. They are all stripped before the counting takes place

= Can I set a weekly goal? =

Not for now. Only a daily goal is supported.

= What about sites with multiple authors? =

The word counting process is global. Right now, all the writing of all authors is added up.
